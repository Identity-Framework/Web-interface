		<name>Scenario 1</name>
		<description>We consider a legal case in which a theft has occurred immediately following a party, providing a list of possible suspects in the form of a guest list. Evidence from the crime scene reveals a group photograph from a security camera with one guest with their hand on the door where the valuables were kept and a fingerprint from that same door. This case can be describe as a constellation of situations, centering around two separate id -situations for the two pieces of evidence: fingerprint and the snapshot.</description>
